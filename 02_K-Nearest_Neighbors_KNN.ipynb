    "# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the 'k' nearest data points to a given point and making a prediction based on the majority class of those neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Theory/Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is KNN?\n",
    "KNN is a non-parametric algorithm, meaning it doesnâ€™t make any assumptions about the underlying data. It classifies a data point based on the majority class of its 'k' closest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does KNN work?\n",
    "1. **Choose a value for 'k'**: Typically, a small odd number.\n",
    "2. **Distance Metric**: Calculate the distance between data points (e.g., Euclidean distance).\n",
    "3. **Prediction**: Assign the class that is most common among the 'k' closest neighbors.\n",

    "## 3. Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Iris dataset to demonstrate how KNN can classify the species of an iris flower based on its features.\n",

    "iris = datasets.load_iris()\n",
    "X = iris.data  # Features\n",
    "y = iris.target  # Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split data into training and testing sets\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize and train a KNN model with k=3\n",
    "knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)\n",
    "knn.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",

    "# Make predictions on the test data\n",
    "knn_predictions = knn.predict(X_test)\n",

    "# Display the predictions\n",
